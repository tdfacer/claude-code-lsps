# Claude Code LSPs

This repository contains a [Claude Code marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) with plugins that offer LSP servers for TypeScript, Rust, Python, Go, Java, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Ruby, C#, PowerShell, HTML/CSS, LaTeX, BSL, and Terraform.  [LSP servers](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol) provide powerful and familiar code intelligence features to IDEs, and now Claude Code directly.

[**Claude Code is going to officially support LSP soon.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1otdfo9/lsp_is_coming_to_claude_code_and_you_can_try_it)  In 2.0.30 (October 31st) they adding the working beginnings of a system to run LSP servers from plugins automatically on startup, and an `LSP` tool (enable via `$ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1`) that Claude can use to
- Go to the definition for symbols (`goToDefinition`)
- Hover over symbols (`hover`)
- List all the symbols in a file (`documentSymbol`)
- Find all references to a symbol (`findReferences`)
- Search for symbols across the workspace (`workspaceSymbol`)

> [!warning]
> Support for LSP in Claude Code is pretty raw still.  There are bugs in the different LSP operations, no documention, and no UI indication that your LSP servers are started/running/have errors or even exist.  But it's there, and with [tweakcc](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc) you can make it work.

## Patching Claude Code

You can manually patch it, but it's much easier to use [tweakcc](https://github.com/Piebald-AI/tweakcc) to automatically detect your Claude Code installation (npm or native) apply the necessary patches.

Run `npx tweakcc --apply`.  It will automatically patch your Claude Code installation to make LSP support usable.  (It also does a bunch of other things like let you customize all the system prompt parts, create new CC themes, change the thinking verbs, and a lot more.)

If you'd like to apply the patches yourself, go the bottom of this page.

## Installing the plugins

Install them the usual way.  First make CC aware of the marketplace:
1. Run `claude`
2. `/plugin marketplace add Piebald-AI/claude-code-lsps`

Then enable the plugins of your choice:
1. Run `claude`
2. Type `/plugins`
3. Choose `Browse and install plugins`
4. Enter the `Claude Code Language Servers` marketplace
5. Select the plugins you'd like with the spacebar (e.g. TypeScript, Rust)
6. Press "i" to install them
7. Restart Claude Code
